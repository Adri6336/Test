# Test

I'm just trying to figure out github. I've uploaded a C++ practice program I just made.
The prorgam will ask you to declare a vector size and a particular number between 1 and 
100. The vector will then be randomly generated and searched (using a linear search).
Once the requested value has been found, the program will report its position; if the 
value cannot be located, the program will say so.
